Health Hack 2016 - All Scotland GPs

This combines two combined data sets: 

Published GP contact details 
(from here: http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/General-Practice/Workforce-and-Practice-Populations/Workforce/) 

and published Practice details 
(from here: http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/General-Practice/Workforce-and-Practice-Populations/Practices-and-Their-Populations/). 

This has given us the attached details which provides GP numbers, practices, localities.
